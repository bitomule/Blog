# New blogâ€‹

Welcome to my new blog. After some time on medium, I'm testing a new format: running my own blog.
There are some ideas behind this blog where I'll talk about what I want to talk about:

- No ads
- No tracking
- No comments (related to no tracking)
- SSL (because Google hates sites without SSL)

To make this work I'm using Ghost and I'm hosting it on my own NAS so I don't have to pay for the hosting.

As I won't have comments feel free to write me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Bitomule).

You can find my medium blog [here](https://medium.com/@Bitomule), I don't know if I'll keep posting there (but everything will be here available here)
