In this case that interested was powered by my old hosting getting into constants problems. I don’t use this blog much but each time I wanted to share a link to explain something the docker running in my home NAS failed.</p><p>It was failing for many reasons, all related to how difficult it is to host something at home using a home network. Last months were better, I was able to fix a huge issue related with the NAS network and it was working 99.99% of the time but I still had to keep docker running always and eating resources from my not so big NAS.</p><p>So, I decided to give <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">John Sundell Publish</a> a chance following <a href="https://www.staskus.io/posts/2020-01-26-publish/">this post</a>. It was really easy because Povilas also has all the blog code on GitHub so he solved one of my big issues: HTML &amp; CSS. Based on his amazing work I was able to get the blog up and running.</p><p>Some changes from my previous blog:</p><ul><li><strong>New design</strong> (still really simple)</li><li><strong>100% static</strong>. For me, that means hosting in GitHub for free</li><li><strong>Fast</strong>: Because it’s just plain HTML + CSS, served from GitHub and using Cloudflare blog is now crazy fast (As it should be, is just text)</li></ul><p>What hasn’t changed:</p><ul><li><strong>No tracking</strong>: I hate websites tracking so I’m not going to add one to my blog. The only metrics I get are from Cloudflare and that’s just the number of visits.</li><li><strong>https</strong>: It was just a toggle in Cloudflare so...</li></ul><p>That’s all for today, please let me know on twitter if you’ll like to read a post explaining all the blog migration process including Publish usage, GitHub pages, and Cloudflare.</p></div></div></div><div class="footer pure-u-1"><div class="pure-u-1">© 2020 Bitomule's learning shack</div><div class="pure-u-1">Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.
