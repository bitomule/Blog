I saw lot's of options, the most commonly used was Google Analytics but that was far from what I wanted. When I was about to lose hope I found <a href="https://usefathom.com">Fathom</a> and suddenly all the checks were marked:</p><ul><li><strong>Respects user privacy?</strong> Yep, that's one of their core values. (You can read more about this <a href="https://usefathom.com/data/">here</a>)</li><li><strong>Self-hosted?</strong> Yep, It's open source and you can host it yourself.</li><li><strong>Free?</strong> Hell yes</li><li><strong>Easy to run with my current docker setup?</strong> Well, they have an official docker image, so it should be</li></ul><blockquote><p>Spoiler: Using their official docker image wasn't easy.</p></blockquote><p>I went to my beautiful <a href="https://blog.bitomule.com/using-portainer-to-manage-container-station/">portainer</a> client ready to install Fathom from the official image and after a few seconds, it was running. It was running but how do I configure it? Is there any shared volume I can use? Nothing... I couldn't make the official image work. <img src="/content/images/2019/03/200.gif"/> I went back to docker hub and I found another image, not official in this case but it had the missing part I needed: a volume.</p><p>This image was <strong><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/geerlingguy/fathom">geerlingguy/fathom</a></strong> and again, in a few seconds, I had it working in portainer. I created a new shared volume (<a href="https://blog.bitomule.com/using-portainer-to-manage-container-station/">check my post about portainer to read about that</a>) and there started those tricky parts you spend hours searching on google because you don't know how to fix. But don't worry, I have all of them ready for you:</p><ul><li>You have to create and .env file in your shared volume with the content</li></ul><pre><code>     <span class="type">FATHOM_SERVER_ADDR</span>=<span class="number">9000</span>
    <span class="type">FATHOM_GZIP</span>=<span class="keyword">true</span>
    <span class="type">FATHOM_DEBUG</span>=<span class="keyword">true</span>
    <span class="type">FATHOM_DATABASE_DRIVER</span>=<span class="string">"sqlite3"</span>

</code></pre><ul><li>In order to protect your Fathom with user and password you should run in your docker terminal (connecting with portainer is really easy) :</li></ul><p>fathom user add <a href="--email="youremail@blabla.com">--email="youremail@blabla.com</a>" --password="strong-password"</p><ul><li>Map the port to want to use to the container port 9000</li><li>Reboot your container</li></ul><p>Once you have done this things your fathom instance should be up, running and accessible. You'll need the service to be accessible from the outside, I recommend using <a href="https://blog.bitomule.com/running-a-website-from-your-qnap-nas/">Caddy</a> so you get the proxy and the SSL for free.</p><p>The last part is adding the code snippet Fathom requires. You'll find it on your Fathom configuration (from the web UI).</p><p>Once you have set up the snipper you'll start receiving metrics on your dashboard free and without compromising your users' privacy.</p></div></div></div><div class="footer pure-u-1"><div class="pure-u-1">© 2020 Bitomule's learning shack</div><div class="pure-u-1">Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.
