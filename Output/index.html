I discovered YNAB listening to a popular Spanish podcast a few years ago when I was working as a freelance and I was struggling to get my economy under control. Having to save VAT each quarter while living in Madrid paying all the expenses was really hard and each month there were new surprises usually related to the car. Ynab changed my life and in this post I'll explain why.</p></div></section><section class="post"><header class="post-header"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/posts/2019-03-12-tracking-your-site-metrics-without-sacrifycing-user-privacy">Tracking your site metrics without sacrificing​ user privacy</a></h2><p class="post-meta">March 12, 2019<div class="post-tags"><a class="post-category post-category-web" href="/tags/web">Web</a></div></p></header><div class="post-description"><p>After having my blog up and running there was one piece missing, I didn't have any kind of tracking so it was impossible to know if people were reading me and what were they reading.

As you may know, I've played with docker on my Qnap NAS. This has to lead me to hate container station software. It has too many limits and issues so as one of my experiments I wanted to find a replacement to it. The best replacement I've found is portainer and as always, when you know what you want the steps to do it are a lot easier.</p></div></section><section class="post"><header class="post-header"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/posts/2019-03-09-running-a-website-from-your-qnap-nas">Running a website from your Qnap NAS</a></h2><p class="post-meta">March 9, 2019<div class="post-tags"><a class="post-category post-category-web" href="/tags/web">Web</a><a class="post-category post-category-nas" href="/tags/nas">NAS</a></div></p></header><div class="post-description"><p>The first proper post of the blog is something I don't do frequently: playing with the web.
